# ByteFightÂ 2025 â€“ Reinforcementâ€‘Learning Agent

> **Competition:**Â [GeorgiaÂ TechÂ ByteFightâ€¯2025](https://bytefight.org)Â Â â€¢Â Â **FinalÂ Rank:**â€¯**8áµ—Ê°**

ByteFightÂ 2025 is a headâ€‘toâ€‘head arena inspired by the classic *Snake* but adds variable maps, multi-move movements and direct combat with the goal to survive longer than you're oppponent. Each bot receives the complete board state every tick and must attempt to stay alive for as long as possible without running out of time.

This repository contains my reinforcementâ€‘learning (RL) solution that climbed to the topâ€‘10 after just several days of training.

## Key Ideas

- **Custom GymnasiumÂ env** â€“ precisely mirrors the ByteFight server API so policies can be trained offâ€‘line and dropped straight into competition.
- **PPO with StableÂ Baselines3** â€“ convolutional encoderÂ + MLP policy trained on 2â€¯M selfâ€‘play steps.
- **Pureâ€‘NumPy inference** â€“ competition VMs allow only builtin Python and NumPy. I therefore reâ€‘implemented the trained CNN layers in NumPy, then imported SB3â€‘trained weights.
- **Offenceâ€‘aware reward shaping** â€“ combines territory control, health conservation, and opponent proximity to teach both evasive maneuvers and aggressive traps.

## Overcoming Server Constraints

ByteFight finals ran on strippedâ€‘down Docker images with **no** PyTorch, Gymnasium, or Stableâ€‘Baselines3.  The workaround:

1. **Weight Extraction** â€“ Trained custom network using stablebaseline and then extracting paremeters after training
2. **NumPy CNN** â€“ implement conv/ELU/maxâ€‘pool/dense layers in Numpy
3. **Load & Run** â€“ load parameters on competition servers before using custom network to perform inference/

## Results

- 8áµ—Ê° place overall (singleâ€‘elimination finals).
- Highâ€‘scoring fully RLâ€‘based entrant; other top bots relied on handâ€‘crafted heuristics.
