Notes:
Great Divide presents a particularly difficult challenge due to the need for far lookaheads to avoid suicide and trapping


Improvements:
    - Avoiding Death
        - Approximate lookahead for safe moves in order to drastically extend range
        - Potential prediction of other players moves a certain (smallish) distance ahead in order to avoid getting trapped
        - Are we taking into account portals, enemy positions, and other weird objects?
        - Suicides still can happen because lookahead is only based on my snake's moves not on potentially other snake's moves
 
    - Attack phase
        - Adding traps to attack phase
        - Taking into account portal and other werid objects in order to more quickly reduce distance to opponent
        - Pretty sure attack is based on limiting number of oppponents immediate moves. What about going beyond just immediate
    
    - Farming (defensive) phase
        - make smarter
        - maybe move away from opponent in addition to getting apples
    

    - Increase Efficency of algorithms
  



- We need to consider not only moves that reduce the enemy's moves by the most, but moves which force the enemy to move in a way that on the next turn or turn after next turn etc, given our optimal moves there is less moves.
