class PlayerBoard:
    """
    A wrapper around the Board class to be able to call board and
    snake functions from the player's perspective.

    Any coordinates should be given to the board in the form of x, y.
    Game objects are displayed, indexed, and stored on the 
    board arrays as arr[y, x] for geometrical accuracy. Mask functions return
    arrays that should be indexed by [y, x].

    Check_validity is on by default for most functions, but slows
    down execution. If a player is confident their actions are valid,
    they can directly apply turns and moves with check_validity as false.

    Be wary that invalid actions/turns/function calls could lead to functions throwing
    errors, so make sure to handle them with a try/except in case so that
    your program doesn't crash. If an apply function throws an error,
    it is not guarenteed that the board state will be valid or that the state
    will be the same as when the function started.
